Why this?
---------

Because every time I see someone be confused about monitoring, or not even having any monitoring at all (due to whatever reason), I get an urge to help them fix it. Monitoring is good, and people shouldn't have to struggle so much with it.

Why me?
-------

Over the last few years, I've spent a considerable amount of time dealing with monitoring various platforms. Both network devices, and systems. Of various shapes, sizes, portcounts, processorcounts, SAN-types, ... you get the idea. And after talking it out with some other people time and again on some useful channels on IRC, I figured it was time to stop repeating myself and maybe put this stuff up somewhere more usefully.

What's the intention?
---------------------

To, over the course of time, develop soem reference material that'll help people go from the question "okay, so how do I monitor my <x> thing?" to having comprehensive and correct monitoring for their needs.
